# Iris_Flowers-EDA-

Welcome to the Iris Flower Data Analysis project repository! This project explores the famous Iris flower dataset from Kaggle to gain insights into the characteristics of different Iris flower species.

## Overview

The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset in the field of data science and machine learning. It contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset, visualize the relationships between the features, and build models to classify the Iris flower species based on their attributes.

## Analysis

### Dataset

- *Source:* Kaggle
- *Description:* The Iris flower dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each of the three species. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, measured in centimeters.

### Questions Explored

- **Line Plot :** Plot a line graph showing the sepal length of the three species of Iris flowers. Use different colors to represent each species.
- **Scatter Plot:** Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between the petal length and petal width. Use different colors to represent each species.
- **Histogram:** Plot a histogram showing the distribution of the petal widths. Use different colors to represent each species and display a legend.
- **Bar Plot:** Create a bar plot showing the average sepal width for each species.
- **Pie Chart:** Assume that the dataset represents the entire population of Iris flowers. Create a pie chart showing the proportion of each species in the population.
- **Box Plot:** Create a box plot showing the distribution of sepal length for each species.
- **Subplots:** Combine the scatter plot and the histogram into one figure by using subplots

### Insights

Our analysis revealed several insights:
- Sepal length and petal length are highly correlated with the species of Iris flowers, with Setosa typically having smaller sepal and petal lengths compared to Versicolor and Virginica.
- Petal width is also a significant feature in distinguishing between the Iris flower species, with Setosa generally having smaller petal widths compared to the other species.
- Using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and decision trees, we were able to achieve high accuracy in classifying the Iris flower species based on their measurements.

## Conclusion

Our analysis of the Iris flower dataset has provided valuable insights into the characteristics of different Iris flower species. These insights can be utilized in various fields, including botany, ecology, and horticulture, to better understand and classify Iris flowers. Additionally, the predictive models developed in this project can be applied to classify Iris flowers in real-world scenarios, aiding in species identification and conservation efforts. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of data analysis in unraveling patterns and relationships in biological datasets.
